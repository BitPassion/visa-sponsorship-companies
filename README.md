# visa-sponsorship-companies

The aim of this repo is making an updated list of all companies around the world that offer visa sponsorship perk.

I collected a portion of companies that offered VISA sponsorship in **Germany** last year, but this list doesn't contain all companies. So if you have got any sponsership visa or your company offering it, feel free to create a pull-request and try to contribute.


### How can you contribute:
1. Fork the project
2. Open the `/countries/` directory.
3. If the country that yo got visa-sponsorship is not defined yet here, please create it with lowercase name.
4. Search you company name and if it is not exist add it to the end of the list.
5. Send the PR


**Please support us with a shinny ⭐**.
